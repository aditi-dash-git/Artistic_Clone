                    the right athletic shoes with arch support. The second picture focuses on capturing foot arch and
                    volume information. This feature is available on our browser-based app. All the customer has to do
                    is take a second picture using our simple instructions.

                    With foot measurements, arch, and volume information, we can provide a robust recommendation for the
                    right motion control or neutral athletic shoes, and insoles too. We provide the user with a foot
                    arch score (1-100) that goes beyond the simple classification of pronated, neutral, and supinated
                    foot. Insoles can be customized based on the arch score.</p>

                            usually longer and bigger than the foot it was made to fit. True size depends on multiple
                            dimensions & shapes – Heel to Toe length, Toebox shape, shoe width, and toe height to name a
                            few. It also depends on design factors such as fastening (laces or trim), counter design,
                            padding, material.

                            Findmeashoe uses precision 3D technology to measure the shoe geometry and uses Artificial
                            Intelligence to do the fit assessment. In it is scanning facility, the company is certifying

                                technology, we have launched the 2.5D foot scanner for Footwear stores across the globe.
                                The scanner allows the end consumer to scan their feet in the store within 30 seconds
                                and provides a SizeID which contains information regarding feet, well beyond foot
                                length.

                                Many stores still use metal scales that are 100 years old, which provide an indication
                                of your size based on length. In order to provide personalized recommendations to make a
                                purchase decision, there are very few tools other than relying on the sales force's
                                knowledge and training. With our scanner and AI-enabled SizeID service, personalized fit
                                recommendations can be provided to each customer who walks inside the store.
